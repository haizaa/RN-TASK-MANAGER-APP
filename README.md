# RN-TASK-MANAGER-APP
Created with CodeSandbox

"Task Manager App". It will allow you to create, view, and manage tasks with features like marking tasks as completed or deleting them.

This project is simple yet sufficient to implement best practices for TypeScript (TS), React Native (RN), and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
